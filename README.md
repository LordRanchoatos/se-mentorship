## âœ… Important Notes

- **Do not place tasks directly in the week folder.** Always submit inside your personal folder under `submissions/`.  
- **Check the `TASK.md` inside each week folder** for the reading targets, tasks, and submission guidelines.  
- Use **lowercase and hyphens** for your folder name (e.g., `john-doe`).
